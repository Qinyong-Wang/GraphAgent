# GraphAgent

Implementation of Graph Agent https://openreview.net/forum?id=s-ditXTwST

I am still working on refactoring and revising the code for the framework and more friendly APIs. 
The original implementation was base on Milvus, I am considering switching to Pinecone.

Fast experiment notebook are provided for now, the nodes were sampled and encoded to text(prompt), so that they could be easily used to see the reasoning results
